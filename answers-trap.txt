Read the code in call.asm for the functions g, f, and main. The instruction manual for RISC-V is on the reference page. Answer the following questions in answers-traps.txt:

1.Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?

24:	4635                	li	a2,13

a2

2.Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

26:	45b1                	li	a1,12

compiler computed f(8)+1=12

3.At what address is the function printf located?

000000000000064a

4.What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

0x38, after jalr instruction

编译时包含了-fno-omit-frame-pointer选项，所以可以backtrace

backtrace中由于栈帧上面保存的是返回地址，所以回溯的时候减4已得到调用的地址
